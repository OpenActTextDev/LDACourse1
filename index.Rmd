## Why Loss Data Analytics? {-}

The intent is that this type of short course will eventually permeate throughout the actuarial curriculum. Given the dramatic changes in the way that actuaries treat data, analysis of loss data seems like a natural place to start. The idea behind the name **loss data analytics** is to integrate classical loss data models from applied probability with modern analytic tools. In particular, we recognize that big data (including social media and usage based insurance) are here to stay and that high speed computation is readily available.

## Resources {-}

- This tutorial is based on the first five chapters of the open and freely available book [Loss Data Analytics](https://openacttexts.github.io/).
    -  [Sample code](https://openacttexts.github.io/LDARcode/) is available for the book, although not needed for this tutorial.
- As described in how to navigate this tutorial below, you will not need to download any data for this course. However, if you want to have the data to follow up, we generally make it available through buttons such as:
    *  <button download><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenActTextDev/LDAShortCourse1/main/Data/PropertyFundInsample.csv">View the Property Fund Data as a .csv file.</a></button> Then, do a "Save Page as" if you wish to download.
    *  Alternatively, go directly to the [Github page](https://github.com/OpenActTextDev/LDAShortCourse1/tree/main/Data) to access the data.
- For advanced data applications in insurance, you may be interested in the series, [Predictive Modeling Applications in Actuarial Science](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/statistics-probability/statistics-econometrics-finance-and-insurance/predictive-modeling-applications-actuarial-science-volume-1). 


## How to Navigate this Tutorial {-}

-  This online tutorial is designed to guide you through the foundations of modeling loss data. 
-  The anticipated completion time is approximately six hours.
-  The tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the foundations in the statistical software `R`, such as Datacamp's [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r%20).

**Role of Video Introductions.** There are five chapters in this tutorial that summarize the foundations. Each chapter is subdivided into several sections. At the beginning of each section is a short video, typically 4-8 minutes, that summarizes the section key learning outcomes. Following the video, you can see more details about the underlying `R` code for the analysis presented in the video. 

**Role of Exercises.** Following each video introduction, there are one or two exercises that allow you to practice skills to make sure that you fully grasp the learning outcomes. The exercises are implented using an online learning platform provided by [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) so that you need not install `R`. Feedback is programmed into the exercises so that you will learn a lot by making mistakes! You will be pacing yourself, so always feel free to reveal the answers by hitting the `Solution` tab. Remember, going through quickly is not equivalent to learning deeply. Use this tool to enhance your understanding of one of the foundations of data science.

## A word from our Sponsors: <br> Astin + Education = Astin Academy {-}

***

In this video, you learn about:

-  the role of the [ASTIN section](https://www.actuaries.org/iaa/IAA/Sections/ASTIN_NEW/IAA/Sections/ASTIN_NEW/ASTIN_HOME.aspx), the non-life section of the International Actuarial Association
-  their recent interest in education
-  their development of the recently formed *Astin Academy*.

>"*The mission of the ASTIN Academy is to provide high quality free educational materials in non-life insurance to actuarial students across the world. The Academy is committed to open course development under Creative Commons licence and seeks innovation in teaching methodologies and application of technology. Letâ€™s build the future of actuarial education together.*"
