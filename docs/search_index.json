Resources How to Navigate this Tutorial A word from our Sponsor: Astin + Education = Astin Academy Contributors", " Loss Data Analytics: Short Course A short course authored by the Actuarial Community Preface Date: 21 January 2021 Why Loss Data Analytics? The intent is that this type of short course will eventually permeate throughout the actuarial curriculum. Given the dramatic changes in the way that actuaries treat data, analysis of loss data seems like a natural place to start. The idea behind the name loss data analytics is to integrate classical loss data models from applied probability with modern analytic tools. In particular, we recognize that big data (including social media and usage based insurance) are here to stay and that high speed computation is readily available. Resources This tutorial is based on the first five chapters of the open and freely available book Loss Data Analytics. Sample code is available for the book, although not needed for this tutorial. As described in how to navigate this tutorial below, you will not need to download any data for this course. However, if you want to have the data to follow up, we generally make it available through buttons such as: View the Property Fund Data as a .csv file. Then, do a “Save Page as” if you wish to download. Alternatively, go directly to the Github page to access the data. For advanced data applications in insurance, you may be interested in the series, Predictive Modeling Applications in Actuarial Science. How to Navigate this Tutorial This online tutorial is designed to guide you through the foundations of modeling loss data. The anticipated completion time is approximately six hours. The tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the foundations in the statistical software R, such as Datacamp’s Introduction to R. Role of Video Introductions. There are five chapters in this tutorial that summarize the foundations. Each chapter is subdivided into several sections. At the beginning of each section is a short video, typically 4-8 minutes, that summarizes the section key learning outcomes. Following the video, you can see more details about the underlying R code for the analysis presented in the video. Role of Exercises. Following each video introduction, there are one or two exercises that allow you to practice skills to make sure that you fully grasp the learning outcomes. The exercises are implemented using an online learning platform provided by Datacamp so that you need not install R. Feedback is programmed into the exercises so that you will learn a lot by making mistakes! You will be pacing yourself, so always feel free to reveal the answers by hitting the Solution tab. Remember, going through quickly is not equivalent to learning deeply. Use this tool to enhance your understanding of one of the foundations of data science.

Exploring Claim Severities Assignment Text The Wisconsin Property Fund data covering years 2006-2010 has already been read into a data frame called Insample. These data includes the average claim severity yAvg. The video explored the distribution of the claims severity for year 2010; in this assignment, we conduct a similar investigation for year 2009. Instructions Use the function subset() twice, once to create a smaller data set based on year 2009 experience and again to restrict consideration to fund members with positive claims. From this subset, define the average claim severity as a global variable. Use the function length() to determine the number of members with positive claims. Use the function summary() to calculate several summary statistics. Use the function hist() to produce histograms that visualize the claim severity distribution. Do this once on the original scale and again on the logarithmic scale. Use the mfrow switch in the function par() to set the graphical parameters so that the graphs can be viewed side-by-side to promote comparisons. 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 1.4.2 Exercise. Skewness of the Claim Severity Distribution Assignment Text Many distributions used in insurance analytics are skewed. In this assignment, we demonstrate how to detect the skewness and show that skewness is a feature of an entire data set, not the result of a handful of outlying observations. Specifically, we consider the average claim for year 2010 of the Wisconsin Property Fund data that has been made available in the variable AvgClaim; this variable is only for fund members with positive claims. The video remarked on the skewness of this variable and used a logarithmic transformation to facilitate the analysis. In this assignment, we show how an alternative strategy, omitting unusually large observations, does not address the skewed nature of the distribution. Instructions Use the functions mean() and median() to compute both the mean and median of AvgClaim. You will see that the mean is much larger than the median, a classic diagnostic approach for establishing the right skewness of a distribution. Use the function order() to order the data in terms of decreasing size. Use the function head() to examine the 10 largest observations. Create 6 histograms, graphically presenting them in panels that have 2 rows and 3 columns. In the first histogram, omit the 9 largest observations. In the second, omit the 6 largest. Continuing this pattern, omit 5 in the third histogram, omit 3 in the fourth, omit 1 in the fifth, and do not admit any in the sixth. A careful inspection of this panel of histograms reveals that the distribution remains skewed, despite repeatedly removing large outlying observations. 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 1.4.3 Exercise. Claim Severity by Year Assignment Text Much of insurance analytics is about making predictions of future behavior. To understand distributions in future years, we look at trends in distributions from the current and preceding years. Some simple trends that are helpful not only for understanding but also communicating results to others involve looking at mean, or average, behavior. In this assignment, we examine 2006-2010 of the Wisconsin Property Fund that has been previously load into the data frame Insample. As in the video, by Year we calculate mean values of claims frequency (Freq), average claims severity (yAvg) and coverage (BCcov), as well as the number of fund members. Instructions Use the function ddply() to produce a data frame with the requisite summary statistics. To document results, provide intuitive names of these summary statistics. 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 1.5 Property Fund Rating Variables Video: Rating Variables for the Wisconsin Property Fund Overheads: Rating Variables for the Wisconsin Property Fund (Click Tab to View) A.

Claim by Entity Type, Fire Class, and No Claim Credit Assignment Text Analytics of insurance data has much in common with analytics in other areas but insurance also has its own peculiarities. One of example of this is how one only examines summary statistics for positive claims. (Mathematically, the claim severity distribution is defined conditional on the occurrence of a claim). As a consequence, we often need to write specialized routines for insurance applications. Your supervisor finds useful the analysis completed of claims outcomes by entity type, fire class, and no claim code. To make this analysis more impactful, the supervisor wants you to modify the code to include a basic measure of uncertainty, the standard deviation. Instructions Modify the function created for this specific analysis, ByVarSumm, to include the standard deviation statistic. Note that, like the mean, we only calculate the standard deviation on the sub-sample of positive claims.
